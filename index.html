            <h2>History of Dairy Milk</h2>
            <p>Dairy Milk, a brand of milk chocolate manufactured by Cadbury, was first introduced in 1905 in the United Kingdom. The initial recipe consisted of a higher proportion of milk than its competitors, making it stand out in the market. Over the years, Dairy Milk has become one of the best-selling chocolates globally, known for its smooth and creamy texture. The iconic purple packaging, introduced in 1920, has become synonymous with the brand. Today, Dairy Milk is available in over 30 countries, beloved by chocolate enthusiasts worldwide.</p>
